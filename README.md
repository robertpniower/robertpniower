## 🚀 One-minute pitch

Hi, my name is **Robert Pniower**. A few years ago, while managing a restaurant kitchen, I built a small tool to track inventory and schedules — and realised I enjoyed coding it more than running the kitchen. That’s when I decided to turn my passion for technology into a new career.

I completed a **2-year software development apprenticeship**, a **Web Development & AI Bootcamp at Le Wagon**, and a **6-month internship at Delivery Hero**, where I implemented end-to-end tests with **WebdriverIO**, worked with **React** and **Node.js**, and contributed to CI/CD pipelines. I focus on building **reliable, scalable full stack applications**.

My background in hospitality taught me **leadership, teamwork, adaptability, and problem-solving under pressure** — transferable skills I bring to agile engineering teams. I’m looking to continue my journey as a **Full Stack Engineer in Barcelona**, contributing to meaningful projects that blend creativity and solid engineering.
